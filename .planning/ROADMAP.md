# Roadmap: Abysslink

## Overview

Abysslink ships as a single static Go binary that automates a paranoid-by-default phone-to-laptop remote-control setup over Tailscale. The build journey follows the IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md phase structure: repo skeleton first, then a solid CLI foundation, then platform abstractions, then Tailscale integration, then the full module system with all core modules, then the complete command surface, then optional modules (claudecode, code-server, ttyd, eternal-terminal), then release infrastructure, and finally end-to-end conformance verification and polish. Every phase produces something independently verifiable before the next phase starts.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Repo Bootstrap** - Initialise repo skeleton, CI, and goreleaser pipeline; `make lint test` is green
- [x] **Phase 2: Core CLI Scaffold** - Cobra command tree, config struct, shell.Runner, audit log, Printer, and TUI forms in place
- [x] **Phase 3: Platform Abstraction** - Darwin and Linux platform impls with package manager, keychain, service installer, and distro detection
- [x] **Phase 4: Tailscale Integration** - Local API client, HuJSON ACL editor, OAuth admin client, and Tailnet Lock shell wrapper
- [x] **Phase 5: Module System & Core Modules** - Module interface, runner, and all 11 core modules (Tailscale, SSH, tmux, mosh, notify, ntfy, watch, ACL, Lock, power, hardening)
- [x] **Phase 6: Top-Level Commands** - Full command surface: init, up, status, doctor, repair, enroll, acl, lock, rotate, enable/disable, backup, panic, uninstall, logs, upgrade, daemon, threat-model, and enroll-rig stub
- [x] **Phase 7: Optional Modules** - claudecode, code-server, ttyd, and eternal-terminal modules
- [x] **Phase 8: Release Infrastructure** - goreleaser pipeline, POSIX install script, Nix flake, and mkdocs-material docs site
- [x] **Phase 9: Verification & Polish** - Conformance tool, security audit, and performance budget validation
- [x] **Phase 10: Journey & Rich TUI** - One guided, resumable, rich-TUI user journey with explicit stop points, full security callouts, and complete non-interactive/JSON parity (completed 2026-05-29)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Repo Bootstrap
**Goal**: The repository compiles, lints, and tests clean with full CI coverage and a goreleaser release pipeline wired up
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04, REPO-05, REPO-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` exit 0 on the package skeleton with `doc.go` in every package
  2. `make lint test` exits 0 on macOS 13+ and Ubuntu 22.04
  3. CI matrix runs on ubuntu-latest + macos-latest for Go 1.22 and 1.23 and passes on a fresh PR
  4. `goreleaser --snapshot` produces darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64 archives plus .deb and .rpm
  5. Repo has Apache-2.0 LICENSE, NOTICE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore, .editorconfig, and .golangci.yml
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Go module init + Apache-2.0 legal files + .golangci.yml tooling config
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — Makefile (6 targets) + full package skeleton (doc.go in every package) + abysslink.yaml.example
- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md — GitHub Actions CI matrix + goreleaser release pipeline

### Phase 2: Core CLI Scaffold
**Goal**: Developers can run any `abysslink` subcommand stub, config round-trips cleanly, and every cross-cutting internal (shell, audit, printer, TUI) has full test coverage
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, CLI-05, CLI-06, CLI-07, CLI-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `abysslink --help` lists every subcommand from DESIGN.md §5; each responds to `--help`
  2. `--dry-run` is the active default for all mutating subcommands; `--apply` is required to mutate
  3. Config struct round-trips cleanly from YAML; unknown keys error in strict mode; `abysslink.yaml.example` passes its own validation
  4. `internal/shell` has 100% test coverage via `MockRunner`; no bare `os/exec` calls exist outside that package
  5. Audit log writes JSON-line entries with backup; `Restore(ts)` round-trips; no secret content appears in log body
  6. Printer snapshot tests pass in both human and `--json` modes with `NO_COLOR` respected
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01-PLAN.md — Go dependencies + cmd/abysslink/main.go wiring + Cobra command tree (all subcommand stubs)
- [ ] 02-02-PLAN.md — internal/config (Config struct, Defaults, Load, Validate) + internal/shell (Runner, ExecRunner, MockRunner) with 100% coverage
- [ ] 02-03-PLAN.md — internal/audit (Append, Backup, Restore) + internal/cli/printer + internal/tui (styles, forms) + make lint test gate

### Phase 3: Platform Abstraction
**Goal**: Abysslink can install packages, manage services, store secrets in the OS keychain, and detect disk encryption status on both macOS and Linux without any platform-specific code leaking above `internal/platform`
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: PLAT-01, PLAT-02, PLAT-03, PLAT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `Platform` interface is satisfied by Darwin and Linux impls; stub compiles for cross-compile targets
  2. Linux distro detection from `/etc/os-release` correctly maps debian/ubuntu/fedora/rhel/centos/arch/nixos to the right package manager in table-driven tests with fixtures
  3. Keychain adapter stores and retrieves a secret without putting it on argv; macOS uses `security`, Linux tries `secret-tool` then `pass` then emits a clear error
  4. Service install/uninstall round-trip leaves no launchd plist or systemd unit artifacts on disk
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Tailscale Integration
**Goal**: Abysslink can query and drive tailscaled, edit ACLs round-trip in HuJSON, call the Tailscale admin API, and shell Tailnet Lock operations — all against mocked or real backends
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: TS-01, TS-02, TS-03, TS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `internal/tailscale/local.go` correctly reports Status, IP, Hostname, and Lock state and handles both open-source tailscaled and the GUI variant
  2. `internal/tailscale/acl.go` parses, mutates, and re-serialises a real HuJSON ACL preserving comments and trailing commas; golden-file tests pass
  3. `internal/tailscale/admin.go` OAuth flow completes against an `httptest.Server`; manual-mode degrades to clipboard+browser-open
  4. `internal/tailscale/lock.go` Init captures disablement secrets to stdout and never writes them to disk; integration test passes against real `tailscale` binary
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Module System & Core Modules
**Goal**: `abysslink up --apply` converges every core module in dependency order; each module is independently testable and idempotent; a second run on an already-converged machine is a no-op
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: MOD-01, MOD-02, MOD-03, MOD-04, MOD-05, MOD-06, MOD-07, MOD-08, MOD-09, MOD-10, MOD-11, MOD-12, MOD-13
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Module interface (Detect, Plan, Apply, Verify, Repair) is implemented by all 11 core modules; dependency graph produces correct topological order
  2. Module runner propagates context cancellation; a second `up --dry-run` on a converged machine produces an empty plan
  3. ntfy server config binds exclusively to the tailnet IP; health check verify passes; admin password is in keychain and never appears in audit log
  4. `abysslink notify "title" "body"` delivers a notification via the ntfy backend; socket round-trip is under 100 µs
  5. `abysslink watch add/list/remove` works; pane-idle, file-tail, and HTTP-change watchers hot-reload on YAML change inside `abysslinkd`
  6. Hardening module: `doctor` fails closed on macOS if FileVault is off; warns on Linux if home is on an unencrypted disk
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 6: Top-Level Commands
**Goal**: Every user-facing command documented in DESIGN.md §5 is fully implemented and acceptance-tested; the CLI is the complete product surface
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: CMD-01, CMD-02, CMD-03, CMD-04, CMD-05, CMD-06, CMD-07, CMD-08, CMD-09, CMD-10, CMD-11, CMD-12, CMD-13, CMD-14, CMD-15, CMD-16, CMD-17, CMD-18
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `abysslink init` completes an interactive wizard end-to-end with scripted inputs and writes a valid `abysslink.yaml`
  2. `abysslink up --apply` on a fresh machine converges all enabled modules; `--dry-run` on a converged machine completes in under 3 seconds
  3. `abysslink status` renders a one-screen summary in under 500 ms warm / 2 s cold; `--json` mode is machine-parseable
  4. `abysslink doctor` exits 0/1/2 with correct severity; every footgun from `04-troubleshooting.md` has a corresponding check
  5. `abysslink panic` completes all revocations within 10 seconds with no confirmation prompt and logs to audit and ntfy
  6. `abysslink enroll phone` mints a tagged auth key, displays ANSI-art QR, polls for device join, and produces a printable PDF runbook
  7. `abysslink upgrade` verifies the sigstore/cosign signature before replacing the binary; refuses to run as root
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 7: Optional Modules
**Goal**: The four optional modules (claudecode, code-server, ttyd, eternal-terminal) are installable, configurable, and verifiable via `abysslink doctor`
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: OPT-01, OPT-02, OPT-03, OPT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `claudecode` module writes `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks calling `abysslink notify`; Anthropic API key is stored in keychain; `doctor` checks for post-reboot keychain unlock
  2. `code-server` module installs, binds to tailnet IP only, stores password in keychain, and is HTTPS-reachable on ACL-granted port
  3. `ttyd` module installs with `tailscale cert` HTTPS, binds to tailnet IP, and emits a basic-auth warning on first access
  4. `eternal-terminal` module installs ET server + client, installs a service unit, and grants ACL tcp/2022
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 8: Release Infrastructure
**Goal**: Any tagged `v*` commit produces signed, verifiable multi-arch release artifacts installable via a one-liner on macOS and Linux; Nix users can build from the flake; docs deploy automatically
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: REL-01, REL-02, REL-03, REL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `goreleaser --snapshot` produces all four OS/arch binaries, .deb, .rpm, SBOM, and cosign signature without error
  2. `scripts/install.sh` runs without root on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 40, macOS 13, and macOS 14; cosign-verifies the download; shellcheck exits 0
  3. `nix flake check` passes; `nix build .#abysslink` produces the binary
  4. `mkdocs build` succeeds; docs site includes quickstart, module pages, threat model, troubleshooting, FAQ, and contributing
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 9: Verification & Polish
**Goal**: Abysslink passes a full conformance run, a security audit, and a performance budget check on all supported platforms; the project is ready for a v1.0.0 tag
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: QA-01, QA-02, QA-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `cmd/abysslink-conformance` drives fresh→init→up→doctor, module disable+re-enable, 6+ break-and-repair scenarios, reboot+keychain-locked flow, and panic+recovery without failure
  2. Security audit passes: no secrets in audit log (grep), no secrets on argv (gosec), no telemetry calls, default YAML matches threat-model defaults, upgrade verifies signature
  3. Performance budget met: `status` under 500 ms warm / 2 s cold; `up --dry-run` on converged machine under 3 s; `abysslinkd` resident under 20 MB; CLI binary under 50 MB
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 10: Journey & Rich TUI
**Goal**: The entire user journey is a single guided, resumable, rich-TUI flow with explicit stop points, complete security callouts, and full non-interactive/JSON parity — enterprise-grade, nothing missing
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-02, UX-03, UX-04, UX-05, UX-06, UX-07, UX-08, UX-09, UX-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `abysslink init` guides a new user from zero to a working phone connection + a verified `doctor` in one command, with a stage progress header and explicit stop points; every stage is independently runnable and idempotent (re-run is a no-op or clean resume)
  2. Every system mutation is preceded by a preview + confirm (or `--yes`), is backed up, and is reversible; fail-closed gates (disk encryption, 12h checkperiod) still block correctly
  3. The interface is live (animated spinner + module progress table) on a TTY and plain off it; `NO_COLOR` honored; never hangs waiting for input in non-interactive / CI contexts
  4. `status`, `doctor`, and `up` emit structured `--json` with no ANSI escapes; exit codes 0/1/2 are correct and documented
  5. All 12 required security notes (USER-JOURNEY-TUI.md §7) appear at the correct journey points; the Tailnet Lock guided path shows disablement secrets once and requires the typed `I HAVE PRINTED IT` attestation
  6. `make lint test` green; conformance scenarios (`cmd/abysslink-conformance`) cover the guided journey end-to-end
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — TUI primitives: Pause, ConfirmTyped, ConfirmBlast, Note, JourneyHeader, SecretBox (UX-02)
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Terminal capability detection (term.go) + structured ANSI-free JSON printer (UX-03, UX-04)
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — Live rich TUI components (spinner, module table, progress bar) + `up` ConfirmBlast apply gate (UX-01, UX-06)
- [x] 10-04-PLAN.md — Pre-mutation config preview + high-blast typed confirms for uninstall/backup-restore (UX-06, UX-08)
- [x] 10-05-PLAN.md — Guided Setup Journey orchestrator (7 stages + resume) + Tailnet Lock once-only secret box & typed attestation (UX-05, UX-07)
- [x] 10-06-PLAN.md — Output parity & polish: exit codes, status/doctor JSON+tables, `--explain`, 12 security notes, panic feedback, conformance (UX-09, UX-10)
**UI hint**: yes
